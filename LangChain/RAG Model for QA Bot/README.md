# Part 1: RAG Model for QA Bot
## Steps:
## Load Dataset & Document Preparation:
Load your dataset or document into the notebook.
Preprocess the text by splitting it into chunks for efficient embedding generation. Use techniques like sentence tokenization and padding 
to ensure that the text chunks are of appropriate size for embedding generation.

## Embedding Generation:
Use a pretrained transformer-based model (like OpenAI's GPT, Cohere, or Hugging Face models) to generate embeddings for each text chunk.
Store these embeddings in a vector database like Pinecone for efficient retrieval.

## Storing Document Embeddings:
Connect to Pinecone and store the generated embeddings. Each entry in the database will include the embedding vector and the 
corresponding text chunk.

## Query Processing:
For each incoming question, generate the embedding for the query using the same model that generated document embeddings.
Retrieve the top-k most relevant document chunks from Pinecone based on cosine similarity between the query embedding and the stored embeddings.

## Generative Response:
Use a generative model like Cohere to generate answers. Concatenate the retrieved document chunks and feed them into the model to generate a coherent answer for the query.

## Testing with Queries:
Test the pipeline by providing several example queries and evaluate how accurately the system retrieves the right information and generates responses.

## Deliverables:
A complete Colab notebook demonstrating:
Data loading, embedding generation, and storing.
Retrieval of document chunks based on the query.
Generative response generation.
Example queries with corresponding outputs.
