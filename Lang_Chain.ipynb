Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based franchise teams. The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.The IPL is the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube. Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established. In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP. In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory. Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers.In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 Seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports, meaning each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million. As of 2023, there have been sixteen seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Chennai Super Kings, who won the 2023 season after defeating the Gujarat Titans in the final.\n",

            "Summary: The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a domestic, annual Twenty20 cricket tournament in India, organized by the IPL Governing Council, under the aegis of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It is the most watched Twenty20 tournament and the second-best-paying sporting league globally.IPL was established in 2008 and currently consists of ten teams in ten cities across India. The inaugural IPL season was won by Rajasthan Royals. As of May 2022, there have been fifteen seasons of the IPL tournament.Up until 2021, the IPL tournament involved each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away, double round-robin format. From 2022, the ten teams were divided into two groups of five. A random draw was used to determine the groups and who plays whom across the groups once and twice. In the group stage, each team plays 14 games facing the other four teams in their group two times each (one home and one away game), four teams in the other group once, and the remaining team two times. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the basis of aggregate points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled \"Qualifier 1\"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled \"Eliminator\"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2. The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier League champion.Altogether, thirteen teams have played in the past ten seasons of the IPL tournament. Of these, three teams are no longer a part of the tournament. In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach. Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan Chargers in 2012 for backing off from its commitments. In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after it had a franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended in 2015 & 2016 following a betting controversy. However, in July 2017, BCCI announced that both Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals would be allowed back into the IPL competition from the 2018 season. The tournament featured eight teams for the 2020 season, including Delhi Capitals, Punjab Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians.Mumbai In\u001b[0m\n",
