# Exam Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Exam" dataset using
 Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to exam and gpa.
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Dataset Description
The "Exam" dataset contains information about students gpa scores. Each entry represents a unique 
dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **Exam**: Indicates the type of examination undertaken by students, such as midterms, finals, quizzes, or tests.
- **GPA**: Represents the Grade Point Average, a numerical representation of a student's academic performance typically calculated on a scale from 0 to 4.
