# Tips Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the python code and documentation for analyzing the "Tips" dataset using
Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to restaurant bills and tips,
including total bill amount, tip amount, customer gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size. 
Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.
