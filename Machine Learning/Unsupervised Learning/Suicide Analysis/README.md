# Suicide Rates Overview Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Suicide Rates Overview" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to suicide rates, including country, year, gender, age group, number of suicides, population, suicide rate per 100k population, country-year, HDI for year, GDP for year, GDP per capita, and generation. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.

## Description
The "Suicide Rates Overview" dataset contains information about suicide rates from 1985 to 2016. Each entry represents a unique record of suicide data and includes the following columns:

- **country**: Country name.
- **year**: Year of the data record.
- **sex**: Gender of the individuals (Male or Female).
- **age**: Age group of the individuals.
- **suicides_no**: Number of suicides.
- **population**: Population count.
- **suicides/100k pop**: Suicide rate per 100k population.
- **country-year**: Combined country and year information.
- **HDI for year**: Human Development Index (HDI) for the given year.
- **gdp_for_year ($)**: GDP for the given year.
- **gdp_per_capita ($)**: GDP per capita.
- **generation**: Generation category.
